I really need to work on how to do a Readme file.  This is the most difficult part of the entire process for me.  I just followed the instructions in the assignment and I answered to the best of my ability.  This exercise was fun to do, I did struggle in plotting the Hotel Name and Country.  The more I practice the functions the more comfortable I am in this type of class setting.  Per Anuj, once you get the basics down, that really opens it up for data collection/manipulation.
